Version 1.7.1.15
Date 2/22/2013

Added the ability to capture external VEDA prices and calculate exposures using old middleware procedures
A config setting UseExternalCalcs is used to override the internal calculations for greeks and exposure 
A config setting GetPricesFromVeda is used to override prices captured from new Pricing Server

Changed the following Scripts

P_MW_GetGenericPNL and P_MW_GetTransactions - Added a parameter to AutoSave. The default is no. This is for future use and makes it uniform the existing scripts.

GetDataFromVeda - Changes were made on the open_closetag to capture all where value <> 'C' rather than = 'o'

P_MW_Batch - Although not used for production, it is still functional for testing and possible emergency usage. Changes were made to to Set AutoSave to True for both P_MW_GetGenericPNL and P_MW_GetTransactions


CSBatch.exe - Added ability to to pass the @AdjustFrom and @AdjustTo parameters which is used by AdjustBusinessDays
	ie toDate = (DateTime)db.AdjustBusinessDays(toDate, @AdjustTo, db.T_Companies.First().DefaultAUECID);
	The default is -1 which is the previous trading day. This allows us to override the default value, such for Cannon.

Fixed bug in UnderlyingMarkPrice when symbol didn't exist in Security Master.
